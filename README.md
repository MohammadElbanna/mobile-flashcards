# FlashCards Project

This is the third project in Udacity's React nano-degree. It's built using React
Native and Redux. It's a mobile application version of Flashcards where you can
create multiple decks and for every deck you can create a set of questions that
you can revise anytime you want.

## Openning in Expo

1. Install Expo application app for Android or iOS.

2. Go to this link ==> https://expo.io/@melbanna/mobile-flashcards

## Getting Up and running

This app was tested on iOS, but it should work fine on Android devices too. To
install the app and test it on your local machine run the following command:
